# NextJS blog starter project

This is a sample blog starter project to test your ability to learn new skills and apply your existing skills to a NextJS project.

## What you need to do

We need you to take this sample project and add some extra features and completely overhaul the visual layout and design of the project to match this [design](https://app.zeplin.io/project/63dbb474e7889e49675a774b?sid=63dbb48f07813648ac4ec56f&sid=63dbb4932ca62a4adc2ff6ec&sid=63dbb4932ca62a4adc2ff6ec&sid=63dbb48f07813648ac4ec56f&utm_source=zeplin&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=new_screen_notification)

## Key goals and deliverables

- Implementing pagination for the index page of the blog as seen in the design
- Matching the design exactly on desktop.
- Making use of [next-image](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image) for images that appear on the index page as well as the hero image on the actual blog post page.
- The project will have to be responsive and work well on mobile.
- We will be assessing your final solution by building the project using `yarn build` and `yarn start` so make sure your project can be built without any errors.

## Dependencies and tools

- You may install any depandencies or tools that may be required.
